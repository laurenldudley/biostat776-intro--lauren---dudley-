# Introducing myself
This website contains a short introduction of Lauren Dudley
## About me

Hi, I'm Lauren a second year MSPH student in the global disease, epidemiology, and control program within the international health department.
I am currently living and working in Uganda focusing on an Air Pollution project. On this project I have been using R studio quite a bit to clean datasets and analysis them.
Through this course I hope to gain skills that help me be more efficient in my current and future work. Outside of this project my research interests are climate and environmental health.

## Five fun facts 

1. I enjoy going to the farmers market and cooking with fresh vegetables
2. I like to go kayaking, hiking, and camping when I can.
3. I like to travel but most of my travel has been in the United States so far.
4. In the summer months I enjoy canning things such as salsa with my mom.
5. I am from Minnesota originally so I am a big fan of snow and winter sports! 

## Interesting website -- Purple Air 
Attached is a link to a website called Purple Air. What is interesting about this website is that you can look at air quality around the world! I am currently using some of this data for my work and I think it is interesting to look at differences in air quality across the global.
